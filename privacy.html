                    <li>
                        In addition to your rights under the GDPR, when you submit personal data via Our Services, you may be given options to restrict our use of your personal data. In particular, we aim to give you strong controls on our use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from us which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in our emails.

                </ol>

                <h4 class="mt-4 font-weight-600">Withholding Information</h4>
                <p>
                    You may access our Services without providing any personal data at all. However, to use all features and functions available on Our Services you may be required to submit or allow for the collection of certain data. </p>
                      <p>You may also restrict our use of Cookies.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 font-weight-600">How To Access Your Personal Information</h4>
                <p>
                    If you want to know what personal information, we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.</p>
                                    <p>
                    All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent via <a href="#">info@agpaytech.com</a>. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible.</p>
                                    <p>
                    There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.</p>
                            <p>
                     We will respond to your subject access request within 21 days and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
